ISQ, as an independent entity with recognized experience and multidisciplinary expertise, conducts expertise investigations upon request from individuals, companies (insurance companies, appraisal companies, etc.), and judicial entities (Public Prosecutor's Office, Courts, etc.).
Expertise involves a methodical examination of an incident that resulted in damages.

This investigation is directly related to the identification of facts and circumstances related to the event, as well as the determination of causes and the development of corrective actions.

The beginning of the expertise involves seeking answers to the following questions:
    - What happened?
    - How did it happen?
    - Why did it happen?

With this information, the expertise team can identify critical factors that caused the incident and determine its causes, using the most appropriate methodologies, including Root Cause Analysis (RCA).

Expertises may involve the analysis of events, components, or products that led to the incident and, consequently, determine failure mechanisms and their root causes, if necessary, by conducting a series of checks and tests, either in the laboratory or "in situ":

    - Verification of projects/calculations
    - Mechanical and corrosion tests
    - Non-destructive tests "in situ"
    - Dimensional control
    - Experimental analysis of stresses and residual stresses
    - Characterization of materials by metallographic and chemical analysis
    - Scanning electron microscopy
    - Some analyses are carried out in collaboration with ISQ group companies, namely ISQ Engineering and NTM regarding dynamic equipment.

Once the causes are identified, recommendations can be made towards their elimination, resulting in the prevention of similar occurrences or, if they occur, a reduction in the severity of damages.

    Combined TG-DTA-DSC system, which allows TG (Thermo-Gravimetry) to measure the mass variation of the sample as a function of temperature or time, and DTA (Differential Thermal Analysis) is used to measure energetic effects when a sample is subjected to a controlled temperature program.

    The analysis of transition temperatures, such as decomposition, melting, or glass transition temperatures, can be measured with great precision. DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry) is the most common thermal analysis technique in the characterization of solids and liquids and can be used for the study of:
        - System for operation from room temperature to 1,650 ºC or from -120 ºC to +1,000 ºC
        - Melting/crystallization processes
        - Degree of crystallinity
        - Polymorphism
        - Glass transitions
        - Thermal decomposition, oxidative stability – OIT
        - Solid-solid reactions, purity
        - Cp – specific heat
        - Thermal diffusivity 0.001 to 10 cm²/sec
        - Specific heat
        - Thermal conductivity 0.1 … 2000 W/(m*K)

    Thermal diffusivity / Thermal conductivity LFA (Laser Flash Analysis) is a technique where the thermal diffusivity of a sample (powders, solids, or liquids) is measured by monitoring the temperature rise of the sample when subjected to a pulse from an energy source.

    It calculates the specific heat of the sample.

    Knowing the thermal diffusivity and specific heat of the sample, the thermal conductivity can be calculated. The system operates from room temperature to 1,100ºC.

    A versatile system that allows measurement in powders, solids, and liquids.

Inspection planning with Risk-Based Inspection (RBI) methodology. Minimize downtime, reduce risk, increase reliability, optimize resources. Auditable process.
It is important to recognize that the implementation of inspection actions may not, by itself, contribute to a significant risk reduction.

On the other hand, the application of the Risk-Based Inspection (RBI) methodology, based solely on inspection history, is not suitable for situations where changes in operational conditions occur.

In this context, the ISQ RBI methodology allows:
- Minimizing downtime
- Reducing overall risk
- Increasing reliability
- Optimizing Inspection and Maintenance resources

The main objective is to provide a strategy that allows the optimization of Inspection and Maintenance resources, with the following benefits:
- Proactive and preventive inspection approach
- Increased availability and reliability (minimizes unplanned downtime)
- Greater flexibility in inspection intervals without compromising equipment integrity
- Increased overall inspection efficiency
- Elimination of unnecessary and non-value-added inspection activities
- Enhanced technical safety, solid and fully traceable, justifying changes in inspection intervals to regulators
- Auditable process

Inspection and direct assessment service for pipelines that does not interfere with the operability of the piping and is aimed at identifying threats and degradation affecting the installation.
ISQ provides a direct inspection service for pipelines supported by various applicable codes.

Best practices in the industry recommend the process of inspection by direct assessment of pipelines for the transportation of fuels when the use of conventional in-service inspection tools (pigs - devices that inspect by navigating the interior of the pipeline) is not possible or economically viable.

It is essentially a structured and documented process that does not interfere with the operability of the pipeline. Its main purpose is to identify threats and modes of degradation affecting the installation, in order to define a strategy that allows predicting degradation mechanisms, their location, and controlling their evolution to ensure the integrity and safety of the installation.
